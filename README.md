## Description

This app was made as I wanted to explore making apps using the T3 stack. It's a CLI app builder that sets up the skeleton of a fully typesafe next js application. I also wanted to play around with using some other integrations like upstash for all the redis stuff like rate limiting, clerk for managing auth and much more!

You can tweet and view your profile and tweets. Will implement likes and comments when I get the time.

### What did I Learn üè´

Main takeaways were learning to use the prisma ORM, tRPC to create typesafe APIs, Clerk for user auth and more!

I also learned how to use:

- Learned more about using NextJS
  - slugs for variable routes for tweets and user profiles
  - How to make a 404 page
  - Using getStaticProps and generateStaticPaths to generate a static page
- Using upstash to implement a redis database for rate limiting
- How to use Planetscale to create and manage a deployed database
- Using create T3 app to scaffold an application
- React Hook Form
